# Go Web API

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple web service written in Go using the Gin framework. The service provides a basic API endpoint for retrieving a list of albums.

## Installation

To install and run the web service, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `go mod download` to download the necessary dependencies.
5. Start the web service by running `go run .`.

## Usage

Once the web service is running, you can access the following endpoints:

- `GET /albums`: Retrieves a list of albums.
- `GET /albums/{id}`: Retrieves a specific album by its ID.
- `POST /albums`: Creates a new album.
- `PUT /albums/{id}`: Updates an existing album by its ID.
- `DELETE /albums/{id}`: Deletes an album by its ID.


To test the service, you can use tools like `curl` or Postman to send requests to `http://localhost:8080/albums`.
```
curl -X GET \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept-Language: en-US" \
    http://localhost:8080/albums
```
